## <small> Reproducibility Project: Psychology </small>

- Replication of 100 studies in psychology
- The mean effect size of the replication  
effects was half the magnitude of the  
mean effect size of the original effects  
- 97 % of original studies had significant results
- Only 36 % replications had significant results

- 36-sites  
- 12-countries  
- 6,344-subjects

“We report how we determined our <br>
sample size, all data exclusions <br>
(if any), all manipulations, and <br>
all measures in the study.”

# <small> Preregistration </small>

Eight questions to preregistration at:  

<a href = "https://aspredicted.org/">https://aspredicted.org/</a>

----

What's the main question being <br>
asked or hypothesis being tested <br>
in this study?

----

Describe the key dependent <br>
variable(s) specifying how <br>
they will be measured.

----

How many and which conditions <br>
will participants be assigned to?

----

Specify exactly which analyses <br>
you will conduct to examine the <br>
main question/hypothesis.

----

Any secondary analyses?

----

How many observations will be <br>
collected or what will determine <br>
sample size? <br>
No need to justify decision, but <br>
be precise about exactly how the <br>
number will be determined.

----

Anything else you would like to pre-register? <br>
(e.g., data exclusions, variables collected <br>
for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)

----

Have any data been collected <br>
for this study already?
